1688-142285-0000 THE DESIGN THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HE IS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STILL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUESTS DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHARP BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKE THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS A THING I LIKE BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF THINGS SHALL BE AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORK HOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORM OF FRIENDS SHUNK FROM THE DISCLOSES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MORTAL PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST MY FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TIDDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT MILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED ASKED A FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OPAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM EARLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE IN MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS AS OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS EYE AND NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPERFECT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WOODS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HIM MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISS THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PURSE ME I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 AND I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SIT HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 BUT GOOD NOT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE WAS SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN A BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS A CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UP ON A SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBERS SOON AFTER DIXON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE COURT A FEW WOODS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PREY OF STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENJOY SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES IN FORMER WOODS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLAD IN HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LISTEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE WITH A MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIMES TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BUSY HEKINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL BUSY HOW ARE YOU

1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TNNED AROUND TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE GO IN A FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWOOD
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK

1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGUERITE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 SHOP US IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AND SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SCALD STRAIGHT BUT HE SAID

1688-142285-0055 CASPACY IT LOST
1688-142285-0056 BUSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGUERITE BENT OVER AND SAID BUSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS

1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU'LL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART

3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMMON
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND SAYS

3005-163399-0028 IS TOM SAWYER
3005-163399-0029 BEING TOM SOYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGH AND LONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF SUPPOSE TOM SAWER COMES DOWN ON AT BOAT
3080-5032-0000 BUT I AM HERE SHE PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS AND CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND A HUMOR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORM PERSON APPEAL LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND A GOLIN
3080-5032-0004 WHY THE BEST ON IT IS I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A NIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN THIS WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGES
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER AND MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RIGID THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITH THEM AND ALL THE KINDNESSES DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I'M VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DEINGS AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES AND ANYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN A COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I THINK MY UNCLE'S BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHERE ABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDING TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET TILL THAT ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BUT BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNTS AND SUCH HAS PRETENDED INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME MY DEAR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS ESCAPE IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN HONEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HUTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE IT ALL FOR SO SINCE A JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ODAINED IT THAT BY THE DIFFERENT HUMANS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITH THEM WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBORS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN IT ON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WILL FIT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM SUDDEN HE KNOWS YET MOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER TO BEAT BUT MUCH MORE CALMLY
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WHEN INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW LONG CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETER'S
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LET APPEASE ME
3080-5040-0000 WHAT IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY LEVISON IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SEE FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY THOMAS
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHAT TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE IN BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER AND FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETCE ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER AND SHE DISERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER GONE IN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
3080-5040-0009 YOU SEE I GIVE YOU FOR WARNING
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GOING TO CAMP AND MY OTHER JOURNEYS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN O INTO COURSE VERY MUCH

3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0017 BUT I AM CALLED UPON
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTED FOR YOUR MASTER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE WORN ONE SIDE OF OUR MOSS AND THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNEDING IT
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE EVIS THAT I ESCAPE DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I RID BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YOU WILL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NOT DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGH TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSON
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SEE OUR PRAY IS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0027 WELL IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS A FINEST BOY THAT ERIC YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT ALL HIS FATHER AT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN USE US WITH DISCOURSES OR A FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOT FOR ANY OTHER TEACHER OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PAUSES FOR WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS FOR THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASCOT WITH NINE PEAS INTO MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PUT HER HEAD DOWN TURNED HIS GOOD BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FANNY AND TOOK PART ON TO HER LAP ARTIFICIAL ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SUPPER
3331-159605-0001 THE MOCK PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDIT
3331-159605-0002 I TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAY BE RESISTED CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE THUS ASK ME AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I AM
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ODD AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HIM MORE THAN ONCE THE WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DUTCHING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE BLESSED LITTLE INTERVIEWS AND USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVE OF ROMANS INTO HER THIN HOT WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHED MEN'S OWN POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDISQUIVABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIGHT OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FOLLOWED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAUNTS A SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE A BEACH INTO REASON WILL OR EVEN CREDITUTE
3331-159605-0014 PARTY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SIDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICOR OF THE LOVE BUT JUST THE ONLY KIND IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE SURELY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECIITION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A EYES PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPIES OF THE OLD EVEN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SET IT CAME POLLY STUDIED ASHUSIA FOUR VISIT TO BACK HE AND BEST BUT COULDN'T RESIST STEPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THAT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DARK BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMMY AND FALK PRETTY LIKE WILLIAM FLAXY SAID THE MATE
3331-159605-0019 AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK LIGHT SCHOOLPOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC QUALITY WAS RELUCTANTLY SURROUNDING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO PONY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULDN'T HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS WHY A GET TO THE ROSS ANSWERED PARRY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT AS FRIGHTENEDNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOESN'T IMPROVE SHE CHOICE TO MAND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU NO
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE AWFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HAND THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS WE SOUGHT TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR PARTY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO AND YOU MADE A LAST BOY AND REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOU LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME AND NIGHT
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUET IN HER AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TO TRANSPONENT AND STRAIGHT FORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITELIKE LOVELY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST IMPULSE THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND EXCEPT IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAITH WITH WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FOR MANY THAT THE UNCLE HAD WHO LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WALKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS YOU KILLED HIM
3331-159605-0035 UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MANY SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE POTLES AND NUTFULS ABOUT REBELS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED PARTY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEER HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIA FAN
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRAYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEN THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN ALL MIND WHAT CITY TEDLESS SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M OUGHT YOU KNOW I PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TONGUE WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST DIVIDE IN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERYONE WAS SO BESIED OF THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANS OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WALKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS THE NET BUTTERED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE ALLER DID ITS WORK AND WEND ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THE ICE WITHIN BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS AFTER SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER ON TOWN BUT SIDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HISIFICATION CAME AND THE VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE OF PARTY BEGUGGED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONES OF EACH TO HIS MOTHER BUT THEIR LETTERS WAS SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY THE MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS DID WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NOW I AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRAVEL BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRIED NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 POOR PARTY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE THEY NEEDED HAD TOLD HER FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE AHEAD IN THE SILVER CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH AND THE HANDERS ARE AFTER
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TEN EARNEST AND DEFINED THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVE AND ADMIRATION OF PARTY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ODD ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GHOST THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARILLA'S ALREADY THINGS SIR SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULDN'T BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TONGUE JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS STUPIDER THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINDOW FROM THE LAST ABOVE THE GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF ANY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED BUT IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLAYS TO MISTER SITNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THE CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME IN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANT AT A SICK DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SOON ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT BRENDA AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND VONDA EDWARDMOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN OUT A DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 THEN HE CAME WALKING IN THE PONDER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE POOR TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HAD HE KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WHO READ
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MY SENOR SAINT FRAUCEOIS GAVE IT TO MY SIGNORE SAINT JULIEN MONSIEUR SAINT JULIET GAVE IT TO MONSIEUR SAINT YOU SEEVIUS MUSE SAINT YOU SEE THIS GAVE IT TO MY SIGNOR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOL GIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THE VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FUNDEVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THE SUBJECT TO ANY ONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BOARD IN THE COMBAT
3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHOCOLATE SIMONIC CORRECT
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT FLY BUT THE DANCERS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE CALLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PYRUS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL PRESENT A SYOGRAPHICAL REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FORVENT

3528-168669-0007 THE SLAP WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT YES
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT
3528-168669-0009 A WOMAN IS NEVER A MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DON MOHAMMED GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN A PISTOLS OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MARL UNUS HORSES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MARILLA'S HORSES NEITHER DO I OR
3528-168669-0011 MARRIAGE CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCTOR
3528-168669-0012 AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 AND CAN YOU GET A LOVER

3528-168669-0077 THE WORLD IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROSS
3528-168669-0078 MARTIN THE ELEVENTH GENERAL OF THE COFUSIONS GAVE TO HIS ORDER THIS DEVICE THAT CREW DOOMEDFUL VICTOR ORBUS
3528-168669-0079 THE PYRUS WHO WAS USUALLY SUBJECTED TO THE BARRIER OF SILENCE AND WHOSE RESERVOIR WAS OVERCOME ROSE AND EXCLAIMED WITH THE ELOQUESTTY OF A DAM WHICH HAS BROKEN AWAY
3528-168669-0080 I HAVE IN MY RIGHT BENNOIS AND ALL MY LEFT BERNARD WHO IS BERNARD

3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WHAT A FOLLY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILKED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY ACQUIRES BY A GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIPS A FINGER INTO THE SURP AND APPLIED TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SERVE WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SKIM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED A PURSE OF MANY VESSEL PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE IS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BORE THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO PARTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHETHER IT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING HAND INTO AN EARTH AND PAN IS THAT THE ASPECT OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SIR WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR UP AND ON A SEA AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEIR TURN
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORIGIN AND WOMENSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MAMMAADES JAMS AND FRUIT PACES OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARGUERITES AND JAMES DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIKELY CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART IN THE RHINES WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERV MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PARISH USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBUTE UNLESS THE JAMES IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBSORS AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOY WAS SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEET BOOTS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATINWARD COMPURSEE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY COSINE
3538-142836-0020 A THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD PURCHASE FROM THE CONFECIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL IN CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 ICES
3538-142836-0024 AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE BOTTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR PAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO EVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE SOME THE TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHEN THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRIED HER HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GO SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH THROUGH THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LET HER BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BENT VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITTED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 MISS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WE'LL GOD SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOOLS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO US THE HOLES AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOOLS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTANCE AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HERE COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME CALM YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOLDS WERE WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLIFF OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THEN HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SITTING LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE CHIEF BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE WHEN SINDER LADD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT AND SERVE TO A PLACE SAID CINDERLAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDER LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAINNERS DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID KIND LAD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKED LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SIMON HAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAFT FROM THE PICTURE AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO YIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS AND THE PRINCESS WHO NOW OR TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROUBLE WHO IS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY'D HAVE A LONG LONG WAY THE FALL SAID GUSCO SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE COLD SEES THAT NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOOL DOESST I NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FALL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINGLE LAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE WAS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED ODTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGION MADE A SWORD AND CIGAR TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGGARD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REKIN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGNARD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGNARD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGNGO SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LET'S DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FASTER AND THEN SAZEN DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN CIGARETTE GREW BACK AND MET REEKEN AND RIGAN ASKED HIM TO ROSTOV AFTER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGN COULD PUT THE HEART OF FATNER ON A STAKE AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THEIR SIGGARD ROASTING CATHERINE'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIGHT OVER HIM FELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BURNHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN CIGARETTE RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 WHENBURN HILL FATHER TOLD GUNTER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND LIVE THEY RODE AND GUNTERSET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BURN HELD AND GUNDRON WERE BATHING BYRNE HELD WAITED FARTHER OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS THUNDERED SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD WRITTEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD

3764-168670-0041 BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SNAILS IN A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN LESS STRAIT THAN THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGOY FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALL OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHETHER IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMBLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TALK PLANK CON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO CALL FOR TO SEIZE

3764-168670-0049 THE EVERPRUDENT COUNTS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ACCOUNTS SOMETIMES INCOME MORE DANGER THAN THE ODACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFINAL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GUESSINGAR'S WITH GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GREAT DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE TOGETHER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THAT'S HOLDS THE UNDERTAKE IS MEN NOT A ROPE PARAND YOU COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIESTS SAYS THE PRIZE MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL I TO BE SO BUT OH HE WILL NOT BE ABLE
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SACKLED FATHER FAUCHEVRE OR WILL GO WELL

3764-168671-0001 THIS HAS CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OF WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ELMS
3764-168671-0002 A MOURNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SUPPERS AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABOUR WHO LIMPED ALONE
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGEST BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG IN EXCERABLY ON THE HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE GERM OF THE INVALID
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOZIAHA IT HINTED AT POVERTY HOW FLESH IS IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PATHLESS CHAS IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTONMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ULTA THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEADRUM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THEY HAD BEEN NO HATE LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONBENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTA WHICH IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTO MEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY NOSES HE PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FEW OURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE
3764-168671-0015 FORTUNATE LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JO VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MEDICINE
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE KNOCKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DUNCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0020 THE PERMISSION FOR INTELLIGENCE MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABOUR IN MAP HE WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATCH UNDER HIS OWN
3764-168671-0022 THE MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIG

3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIG IS TOO DRY THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 HE HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STOMACH
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FOR THE MEDICINE IS THE GRAVE TRIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LIKE A FATHER IN LAW IT'S HE IS A JOB OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 BUT YOU ARE A JOLLY FELLOW

3764-168671-0033 THE MAN REPLIED
3764-168671-0034 HE LIVED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FROM INFAMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVE DID A WALK HOME IN FRONT OF HIM
3764-168671-0036 SO SHOULD HAVE BEEN PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CLAVIE ONCE MORE AND RIVINE
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVO WHO WAS INITTERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TURK HE MUTTERED

3764-168671-0043 FRESHEN VALORTE I AM LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TANS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL EYE LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TENDING OF PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CROAKED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRINCEINIUM FROM WHOM
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES UNCHANGED I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF ORPHE BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 SO YOU ARE NOT A GRAVE TO GET THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVO CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
3764-168671-0051 HERE A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHEUVENT WAS UP HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT HOME WITH A SUPERIOUS SMILE
3764-168671-0054 ONE MUST EAT
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT FOR ME TWICE WHERE TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR RICH
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT'S CEASED TO ME AS IF I DO
3997-180294-0005 I'LL GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGS TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENSES SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST CASTLE OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARCENS BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AND LEAST TO LOVE FOR BE WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE AS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST BE FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST BE LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HANDS OF WHICH HE IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER ON THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNS UP THE HEARTS DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOVED A PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELFWOOD HAS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HIS SELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOFS TO GIVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELDS WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMAN OF WOMEN LOVE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH AND SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DREAMS AT ONE SHOUT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MYLIAS ALL
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I REACHED HOME ALL WAS IN THE STATE OF MAGDEITY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES A MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 WHO WHY
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AND OF VADAVILLE
3997-180294-0023 CALM DURING THE THIRD AND TRAP
3997-180294-0024 THAT BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY THE SAGE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD'S ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARS
3997-180294-0027 TO SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKS THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC ERA WHICH WENT SO LOW WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 WHERE AT HOME
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
3997-180294-0033 THEN THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND LOVELY AGAIN TO THE PARISH WHICH WAS WINNING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0001 YOU IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WON'T WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY PLAYMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND A LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT TO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRET FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEES WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
3997-180297-0012 I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SAYS BY AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HALF FANTASTIC DESIRE AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PALITY OF BEING HOITED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST AND THOSE SELF ESTEEMED LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DID HE GIVE YOUR ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVE US EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE AND OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT FUTURE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND THE OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH SHE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVE IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE HIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PULL UP HER IN THE CHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME

4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY DID
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEAN TIME FRIDAY JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BUTTON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVORED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT A NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS THAT UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHER BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SIR DUROUS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARQUED
4198-61336-0003 TO GLAD LEISURE HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THEIR RATION ARMY AND CUNAK
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF HIS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING JAURIUS WHO LEAPED FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTENTION OF COWRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DOUBT AGAINST YOU OR TWO ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE FIFTY MEANT TO ILL YOU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHOW DORES WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN IN VAIN NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TO GLAD LEISURE HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED THE VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN LAND WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 R PAD WAS CAPTURED AND MET TO VIEW DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HEBOS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE JESERIA
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN THE SYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 GEO ASH THE GRAND SAINT OF JEHU HAD A CHIEF SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY CHALLON
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD THIS WAY AT SAMARIA FOR ONLY A MONTH
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MANY HEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TAKE LAST POLICER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT TO THIS WOOD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HAND ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS UR OR TWO CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMA PRESTIGES AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TO GLAD BELIEVERS RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MANY HIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PECAIAA
4198-61336-0022 JUDA HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLITIES AND CRIME
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAY IT THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEKING ME A YE TO LIVE HAVE HE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINE SHALL PERISH
4198-61336-0026 ISRAEL WAS ALSO DOUBT WITH
4198-61336-0027 HE SWEPT THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE FAIRESTINES AND THEIR ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 HE INVADED BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 THE KINGER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITAL SHAPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THIS BEST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SAID AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES ABOUT WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BEND NARROW QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASKED NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVYOUS FOLKS THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELY UPON HIS FAVOURITE TAKEN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST LUSTROUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHY HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LET ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO AMBALS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMEN GEORGIO DE CORTON OF FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GEORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIS HEALTH
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO THIS GRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BYRNAONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND MONTONI LANDED WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BAR GENERAL
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CANNOT PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINENCES I STRUCK FOR DUKE GALSENDRO WHICH IS STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM INLIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE HONOR KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERRE WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PEACE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN IN RAGE SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEIUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESULT IN HEART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WHILE THERE WAS RATHER SURELY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRITILLIN AND RICHES PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLED AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THE YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND LORD WHO WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED OH ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD IN HIS STEED THAT I MAY UP AND WAIT TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THAT MADE IN SIZE AND COURAGE IT SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING GESTURE BEGAN SURE AGAIN WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SORT OF ETHLEREIDE HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE GESTURE AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN THE DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULD SPEND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE ELDER CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAY THIS FROM THE OGEST MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND NASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THAT SHALL NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHERE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE TO STRID THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLIGHT TO MEET HIM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE BENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS TO A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED DOWN HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME THE GUIDE DUE TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND WROUGHT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVESTED IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE MADE ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR A LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL I SOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHT AWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE EPLORETE'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHEL READ HE DID NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG OF THE PRINCE PRINCESIO
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPENED WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVED LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE'D BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECTED ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINTED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD DISCHARGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENT BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST CURE AC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID CURFRAAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WE DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOSED DEALER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCH MAKERS
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HULLO I'D FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUP VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD AND A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH THE RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT'S TO DO SHE FELT SHE ASCENDING AS KATE
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THEIR HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS NO PATRICIAN NERVOUS INSATABILITY AND SO LONG
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION SENDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TO WORK WITH THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN ELECTRICIAN
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE USE KEEPERS DONE IT OR SHALL I HAVE THE DRIVER ON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED AH IT IS
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT TO A RUN ASKED THE FELLOW DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED AS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING TRADITION ENOUGH LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLED A PREMINISCENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE SAID
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 OH TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU ASK ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATE OF DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS SUITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KING HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WITHY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD DONE
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHAT SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIPLE THE EVERGROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL WAR
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AND CORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTEREST FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO WAS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASES OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSION TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALMEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SAYS THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN AND POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SENSE THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESSENED THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTED
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE SHRINE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL ASSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIAN INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE PRESS ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST WOMAN BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN KNIFES
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIME SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE USES OF AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TRUTHS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY A FOR THE THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG ON PINCATANTS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE DRINK OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSIONS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS IN THE POPE'S ENGAGE SWIFTS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTED THE REPROITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI SPEECH PUT INTO PLAN LANGUAGE HIS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOUR IN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE INSLAY TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THEM THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS I SPORTING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS IN SLAVE SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT THESE AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTE CRISE POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SORT OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSEED THE UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS WHO OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL AUTHORITY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORIOUS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY ADMIT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTED STRIKE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHERS DAYS FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PROTEST OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIKE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL TERRITORY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THAT ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF ESTATES AND MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT WITH A STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED OF THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVARMIN AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES FROM EVIL TO CLOSE PERSONS EVEN IF A HADSOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER KNOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETY'S ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSS FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENT'S NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT MAY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT HIS LABORS
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSAND PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THIS STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BIRDS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGES THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WHAT NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AN EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LIVES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CRIS LOOKED FROM A NICOPLATED FLASH LIKE TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO NEED TO JOB BAN THAT'S JAKIE HEIRESS
4852-28311-0003 O KAY HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHAT DID YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MICK BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FOOT OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN M STREET
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0007 QUISTS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED THE LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 THINK YOU REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOME HAVE THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CRUCID INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 LIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT WHAT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT WHO THIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BUT YOU AREN'T GO IT AFTER ALL THIS TURNED TO HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIGHT WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER
4852-28311-0013 OR SHARKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIST STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WORKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT AN END TO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE EL SHAPE BRICK BUILDING IT SIR MISTER WICKERS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 NO LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK GOT A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND MISS GODSON ABBEY HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF ON THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THAT HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWER AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CRYSTAL DECIDED TO FINISH THE JAW
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE BOTTOM OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAIN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY AND BAGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROUD AND MANY A TIME CRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MERE BELL
4852-28311-0024 HE'D NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WHITTAKER'S SHOP NOW HE'S THOUGHT OF THAT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CAR HORN WELCOMED FROM THIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES YOU EXAMINED MISTER WORKER'S WINDOW AND POURED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NEW BEING BOY IT NEVER GONE INTO MISTER YORKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL THEY LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH ONE WINDOW IN THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HAND YOU AND BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNERED A TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMEED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUS ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIANS HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CRISIS GAZE WITH THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 CHRIST LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 CHRIST SWALLOWED HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 YES SIR HE SAID
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIDE AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 HE'S A SCHOOLMATE EM MINE
4852-28312-0012 GENERES HIS NAME IS HE REALLY ITS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE VOICE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEK GLAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY IN GOOD HUMOUR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE IT MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE ON THAT RUM BEYOND
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE GOODS GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MINDS WHY DO HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING ABOUT AROUND THE CORNER OF WALL UP HER STREET NOT THE HILL TOWARDS THE LIFE OF SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE ROOMS SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019 THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WIND IT WAS THERE BEFORE HIM AND THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 THE WARE HOUSES WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024 FLABRA GAZED IN BREATHLESS CHRIST WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAPLET STREETS
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE STROKE STORE AND STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 A COURTYARD IS FIRSTLY LIT BY FLARING TORTURE TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGH HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POSTS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF IT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MONEY ROAD AND
4852-28312-0029 THE COACH WOULD THAT STOP PILED HIGH WITH LONDON STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLYING COURT YARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE END THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28319-0001 HE TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSTLE HIS HORROR OF MONEY IN HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIST THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WORKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BALL WITH A GOLD FISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WORKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD ALL I DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU OFTEN PROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY MISSUS GO TO CHANGE IS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE A CHANGE AND CATCH IT BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WORKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESOUGHT HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIST TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THAT IS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WHITTAKER SAID STOP AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 A SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NO WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED THE EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT AT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPED BEFORE MISTER WORKER'S ALWAYS BOOMED BUT THOSE BY
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURES SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE OCCURRED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THAN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIST
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HONCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOOD AND FIGURE ATTENTIVELY FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID ONE AND CHANGE INANIMATE TO ENEMY
4852-28319-0018 CRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WORKER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THAT MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY WITH SIR JIM'S PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0021 THUS GAINED TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLED IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FOREBOARDS CREAKED TREE AND STILL CRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE FUNCTION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIST CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHT BEFORE REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES SWOLLEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS RALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CAR FLOWERS MOVED THE EARTH BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT THAT SILLY WAS RELIEVED TO THE HOME BY ELDER JONES HE TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT HAD BEEN HIM IN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL GIVE MY EYES UP AND
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRA BELL WAS NEAR INDEED HE
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE VULTER AND FRESH STALLS TO TAKE ALL THERE
4852-28330-0006 CHRIST LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINN WOULD BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CAN'T BE ON HERD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO OUTDO WAS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
4852-28330-0012 THE SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0013 IN PAUSE FINGERING AS LOWER LIT LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHIONATE CRYSTAL STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU ON THE STAND RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
4852-28330-0015 THE SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MANG WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACED CREASED IN ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRY WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF A SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEN WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 THE CAMOFLISH WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CRISTEL TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILL IN MIDICTMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF SHEEP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABINS AS I CAN CALF YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WORKER AND CHRIST FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD SAID TO BE A WAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 WHEN CHURCH YARDS YOUNG
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSAND OF MILES IN BOX SCAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD

5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D THANK ME NOW TO MORROW I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TO MORROW
5442-41168-0000 THE ACTS SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE ABOUT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGERING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY ABOUT
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VEDY COURSE SOGIE OF ANNOVAGE HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ON HIS BODY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE BODY AND DROWNED AN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME WEDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FAR ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO GO FAR ORDER A BALLET
5442-41168-0004 WE SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NOR SHAKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARTIAN HE'S NOT A GASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VAULTS PLEASE BISSON
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS A MATTER AND HE MARVELLED OF THE FASHION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE POSITION ABOVE FLEROF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERGEANT EVEN OF WHICH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLEGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET IT OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET IT OF THE MARSHAL WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET IT A MAJORITY OF FERROZ'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THEIR RECOGNITION OF FERROZITE DEVOTED THEM WAS DECID ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM GATHER RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE DEATH PRESMAN BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GREE WAS GOOD WEIGHTER WHO SHOWED US GONE FOR THE OTHER YOUNG WHO WAS AND WAS JARRED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NATHAN'S PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LIVING ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE DONE TO SOCIAL EVEN ABAGE WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AMORY TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SO SHE EVEN EMBAGE GROUNDED
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A METAPHOR EACH MAN'S OWN POSITION HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE'D RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE TRUSTED IT THOUGH TOO LEAD AND STILL IN MOREOVER OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 SANG ON THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE A LETTER ARE
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH OF BUTTON AND TWO NUTS WHERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEM SINCE CON COULD
5442-41168-0021 INTO PLACE PENCROFT SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMAN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DISSOLVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBLEITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DISSOLVING THAN I LET THEM SOLVE
5442-41168-0024 AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 THOUGH TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS WAS JOHN DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE BAPTISMS OF NETCOVE AND A THIRD HAD BEEN DROPPED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTEABLE FLUR OFF TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIP OF GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEANING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT A SURGEON EVEN OF IT STEP ON ARCHIVE VILLAGE SWISKI AND THE REST BECAUSE BRONSKY IN AN INQUIRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SET AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0002 HE'S SUCH A BLACK GUARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEAD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FINE GENTLY

5442-41169-0007 OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LAND ON ARE ONSET WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 WHY WHAT IS THAT TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE IS NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN TWO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO DEMONSTRATE THIS ONE'S OWN INTEREST
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF ASSAULT BUT WE ARE THE LANDONERS
5442-41169-0014 THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT TO GARDEN CLIMBING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THEY YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD A CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNAWED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T COME DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE WHOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT TWO BEDS SO AS TO TAKE A VAUNTAGE OF THE SHE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW'S YOUR LAND DOING
5442-41169-0017 BUT ONE'S WALK IS SOWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND ONCE MORE THE LANDLORD WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS IN THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO DAYS FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT OUT AND YET ONE DOESN'T
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEP UPON MISS LIVEAGE EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT TO YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THE LANTERN
5442-41169-0023 HERE ARE OF THOUSANDS OF LINES AND EACH WOULD MAKE DO GOOD BUNDLES OF BACH
5442-41169-0024 YOU MERIT IHOOD SAID THE LANDONA
5442-41169-0025 YES IT'S ALL THIS REGION HE WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LANDOR HAD CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE AND STATACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN OUR BOX FOR TIMBER
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WANDERED UP THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRYS TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT EVER IM TOO AT A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FOR THE BATH RECKLESS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HARMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REBEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EU FRENER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAFTNEY AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MERTELUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS A DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED AND IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GREMMATIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMON'S SIDE WHICH ALTHE HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT AS BLINDNESS DE BARED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILD AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMAN TO WHOM NO TIME BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 TRADES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRD KNIGHTCO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENO'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAMES FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LISTMACUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMAN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEADCHES ENTIRELY WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTICE ODDS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HEPERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES I HEAR AMMY TUS THE LEAD TRICIPUS IN THE ADMIRABLE PROGRESS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVA THE LUCK PROMISING FULL LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISE WORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ALSO KNOW IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WOOD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMONED YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HARMON
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENU HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN ROADS
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMON LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RAWDON WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE OURRSENAU ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNISTON SURE OF THE SCULPTURES ART WHEN CRATES HERMAN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASK THE BLIND ARTIST AND BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HISIMEDOR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO EARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ATHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HER MAN'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT TO LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CREAT AND ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION AND SNAWS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERAMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS ROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISONY OF THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS BARTELS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS A FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT MASSES NO IT WAS A KINDLY DUTY
5484-24318-0010 YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 BLASI WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMAND IN GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERMON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOW THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAIL TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAFT AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIP IN SILENCE CHARM WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH A WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHTING GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTIST IN THE PASTURE THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 TAP ME EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMON WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN HAVE YOU RAISED YOUR FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THAT TO METER IS THE WORK OF MERTELS
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE OR A DEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AN I FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MINE COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHERE THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL IT AND PALIAT NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SORACHIS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN RESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY A MEANAS HERODIAN PRECIPUS AND PROCLAS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROPPED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN AFTER THESE IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM WAS SEATED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FEASTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BUD WAS CORCING SO WIDELY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSETY TOGETHER RICHLY GUARD LANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HEREMON
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULOUS AND JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HARMON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS WHOSE ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MORTALISTS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THAT SNOWBLE FEAST AT ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR A COVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMBS AND LOVES AND THAT IN A CHANGE FOR OR IN ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THESE GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS TO CREATE OR YOURSELF AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER AND HE PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATED THE FORM THEN HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE THE FAILURES AND THE OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS I RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WALLS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HATH BE CHED

5764-299665-0008 IS DISCOVERED RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS EXECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMBSCREW AND WRECK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 IF THIS GOT THE LOAD TO CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTRESS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE OWE TYRANTS TO SHED A BLOT OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE GO SEEF OR A DEVIL DAYS ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN THE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT THE FOUR HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FAINT SECONDS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WILL NINE FEETS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DICK INFINITE WITH THEM INFANTIALLY PRODUCED THE MICROSCOPPING BEASTS THAT FEET UPON THE UP THE EARTH THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFIED THE APPETITE OR FROM MY ROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BEATS THE OLDER ENOUGH WAS THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 IT'S PRETTY PRESENT FEAR FOR TREMBLINGLY REPED THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET DID I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY THAT THEY CARED FOR THE KINGDOM OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 COME WE SAY THAT HE SMERCY AND EUROPE FOR EVER
5764-299665-0020 TO REPROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE US AND SWALLOWED THOUSAND OFF HIS HEAD WAS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WEAK RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS THEIR GOODNESS WAS THEIR WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OLD SUPERIOR RACE TO SIMON CUT THAT THEY HONORED THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE BLINKED THROUGH THE SIPERNATSO
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS THIS POWER
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES TO ITS BEIANS
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A SECOND PLACE COMES TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE IS TRIED THAT RODE AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 THE CHILD SHOWN BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASP IT WITH HIS DIMP OF N
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER WOULD AT WORK FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT THE CHILD LISTEN
5764-299665-0031 IT IS A RESULT
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MEN OF THE SO COLD PELLASPHUS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF BEAUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LEAVE TOGETHER INFAMITIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0034 THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDER THE BAD MENDORS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF BEAUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 MAN JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING FOREVER NATURAL
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HAS CHRISTIANITY DONE GOLD
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD GONE CREW WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGRY OR AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE CONQUERIES HAVE BEEN WORSE WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIANICTY WOULD FAULT THEM
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED PLEASURE
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF BLACKNESS
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEF THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORLD OF THOUGHT AND HIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HAD THE CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEVING THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED A BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED IT HERSELF DO THEYE GENTLY READ DARING
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS HE TRUST JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFEMOUS AS THE CAPITALY SPIRIT
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE VALUABLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGE OR KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 HER LEGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN OLD COUNTRIES IN OLD TIMES AS FAME
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND FAULT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGIONOUS NEVER MADE MEN FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT IS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 OUR CHRISTIAN SMALL TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEAREST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN PECULIAR DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HONOR AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THESE MASTER WE LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT THIS MASTER PERNICIOUS AND HE WROTES THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES TO BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE GONE THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 DESTRUCTION MUST HAVE A BASEMENT
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN AT ABOUT THEM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE IT THEORY AND I HAVE FULL GROWN STONES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE THIS FOR IT CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE SCORNISTS ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND DUE ETERNITY THAT THEY COME NEITHER BEING INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE AND A DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I SAY WHAT I THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVEN HAS PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COOLED
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAIN RACE AND THERE COME BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 WE NOW KNOW THAT ALL FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGN US
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PARTS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE REFORMED THEM
5764-299665-0085 THEY DIPENT ON THE LORD AND LOOK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LEAVE BY FRUIT AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATHED THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE BETRAYED MARK OR NATURE WHY
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PROVE USELESS WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS FOR THY INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT FAULT
5764-299665-0089 THUS THE WORLD FOR EVER REMAINED THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CAN LOOK THEY CARE OF CHILDREN THAT THEY ARE BROKEN AND CURSES WHY
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEATH
5764-299665-0092 YOU COMPENISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY TOK OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREES WOMEN
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WE BE CHILDLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FAULTS AND BARRICADES OR FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FAITH THE FUTURE TO THIS MIND

6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PLEO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS I READ IS OUT WHERE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID FRANZ THE COSCAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
6070-86744-0021 WHY REALLY THE THING SEEMS TO MEET SIMPLE ENOUGH

6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MAN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALL ITS SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID FRANZ WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR DISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENT SAW BEYOND MY POWERS OF REPUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR FRANCE LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE

6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND CAUGHT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT QUOTED TEN THE VALET ENDED HE COMPOSED OF THE LITTLE ROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE IN ENGLISH ALL ALBAT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASER ALSO

6070-86745-0004 VERY WELL AT HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0005 IS THE COUNTESS UP YET
6070-86745-0006 THE VALET LEFT THE ROOM

6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOORISH IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO EARLY
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOSSIPED TO HAVE A RIDE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 BESTS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT HE WOULD FIND THEM ACCEPTABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOME BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 THAT WHAT ABOUT THE CAPES
6070-86745-0016 IN THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCY
6070-86745-0019 WITH THE ITALIANS YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT HAVE NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN HIS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN ENFLEASURING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH MOTHER A WICKED ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGH OUT IN BLACK HIS SHED CUTTLE WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRANQUIL OF LINEN INITIAL TRUMP HOLD EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STAIN
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LIVE WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF VASALNSON WENT DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRY ADDED TO HIS STATUE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRON'S METAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE ALWAYS ESPECIALLY WITH THIS MOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OH ON THE OTHER HAND THERE MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE HE DESIRES TO READ THAT THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATING NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONENCE AND SWATTED HIS VOWALS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ASGIANS AND INTOPULATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS VIEWS WAS EVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AT STRICKEN IN ITS RICH BOSKIN TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEMINGEST POUNDS OF THE COTTON FIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THERE ALL WHICHS AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT DROPERS UNRORE AND RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU'RE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER
6128-63240-0012 AND LOOKED AT MISSUS NOON I WITH INTELLIGENCE AND INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER
6128-63240-0014 HAVE YOU BEEN IN NEW YORK
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWAY
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUSPICION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LENA
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 AND MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T EVEN NOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES UNEXPECTED IN WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH ALL EH SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AND MISTER RENSON A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST BECEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HAVE VISITOR HER REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXACTING THE SMALLEST BRUSHIA
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WELL THEN TO A THIRTY PARTY THAT'S ONE WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSON ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BEATION AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MADE OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIMB AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CASSORIE DEPRORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT EXTREMITY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HAD TRAGEDY
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANYONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS SUMMONING WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THOSE NAMES THAT PROPERTY THE FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THE HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEATS
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DISMAY SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THAT YEARS OF AGE UNITED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE CUSTOM OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BATES AND RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROW HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSON MONEY OR EVEN CLAYS SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASSASSIN IN HER SUCH A SUFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 AND IF HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREAT TO SAY WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO ISABEL RENSON AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT FIND HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE TOOL SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TO MISSISSIPPIEN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 THE WHOLE THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HAUNT AND MENTION FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BAD ACUTEIMATION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BASER RENSON WOULD NOT CARE TO DEPEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHILDHOOD HERSELF FORGOT SO MUCH OF THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAY HAVE YOUR REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE BABE IS UNBEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BARRET
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 BUT HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SOFT AND WISHING NEVER FOOL AS WELL AND IT WERE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0004 I AM HATEED DAY THAT FINE EVENING YOU TOOK THEM OUT AS IF IT WAS SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LOOK THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALSO SHOULD INFERIOR PEOPLE IF THAT AND SAID BRILLIANT TO WOMAN IS MISSUS FARENDA WHO LIVED O PROSPERY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THAT'S UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW A PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARINGERS SUPPOSED SO THAT IT WAS A WANT OF PROSPECTIVE IN TOKEN TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN REPRESENTED EVEN THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISHED TO ACT IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD NOW BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF A PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHALONY WAS A LONG MAN IN A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COMMON IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST NICES THAT THE CAD MATCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0010 ONLY CHANCE I WONDERED HOW MISSUS DINDA WOULD TREAT THAT DOUNTIAL QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WELL PREPARED TO TAKE SENTENCE THATS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
6128-63244-0012 OUR MOMENT IS FOR ALL IT BUILDS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 RANCE DISTOUNDED AMONG THEM AND BRING ME HIS THOUSAND NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CARRANTS MISSUS FOUNDER ADDED IN A TURN AS EXPLANATRY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WHERE THE SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS FILLING TO HELISTNA
6128-63244-0015 SAID HONEST CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A MISSIONOUS RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 I WANT TO BE NEEDED THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HIMSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENTRANCE HUSBAND OF THE SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FORHA
6128-63244-0018 THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE HIS SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THE DEVILRY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WITH THE GREAT THE BEST RELATION IT WAS TRIUMPH IT WAS SWEET THOUGH WITHIN BEFORE IT IT MUST ACCEPT FROM THE OLA THE BROCHO BLOODSTENED RATHER THAN RACE THE LOST POSSIBLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WILLING WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEGRADED IN THEIR REPULSIVE BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WILL NOT COURAGE TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LOSS WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SOLD A MUSCLE THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MISSTRELIMATION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY IS SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BENNET'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGATED FOR MEIA HYPOMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITY HAT SEEMED ALREADY IN MAUSHA
6128-63244-0024 OH IF CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WOULD LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER AND HAD LONG AND REWARDED WARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT ON IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMBLED HER INTO AS MANY TRACES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT EXCUSE ME DEN YOU WILL FIGON DURING SOME DETECTIVE AND GIVEN UP FISHING

6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINK AFOOT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 NOW I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN

6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD HIM SCRAP IN A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN A HAWK AND HEAVY

6432-63722-0026 SURE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARD TO GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWN THE WATCH FOR THE DAGGERS TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LANGUE AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES A TOUR

6432-63722-0032 YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0033 AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL

6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND AND IRON SUGGESTED THAMB WITH A NODDED DESIROUS PATRIOT SLIGHTLY TO HAVE THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIME PIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LED PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DON ON TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0039 ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE YES
6432-63722-0040 DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NOT
6432-63722-0041 SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WATCH

6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCE OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A PATHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF FOR THE SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVEN BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AND YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW
6432-63722-0051 BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK
6432-63722-0052 IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I MAY CATCH SOMETHING
6432-63722-0053 IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I LAND MY FISH
6432-63722-0054 I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKSTONE SAINT SNAPPED KENNETH
6432-63722-0055 WHAT IS IT PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
6432-63722-0056 THE OLD ATAGE OF TWO HEADS YOU KNOW
6432-63722-0057 YES IT'S STILL HOLDS GOOD
6432-63722-0058 NO CEREMONY REPLIED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT
6432-63722-0059 AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP AN NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE TRAIL CARLASH GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALEMONIA INQUIRED KENNETH
6432-63723-0003 NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
6432-63723-0005 WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARGE STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0010 ARENT GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTED GREAT CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 BECAUSE LARGE MADE NO DEFENCE
6432-63723-0014 LARGE BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SCREAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNCIL FEE
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
6432-63723-0018 STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LARGE HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOONKEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH EVER SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT SENT THE A RECORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY

7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SEEKS
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NOT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINBAD THE SAME AND HAD RELIGHTED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SIN BAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT

7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN VIALS A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRIBE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BASARRATAN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FORESE AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TAUGHT HIM IN HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS ENOUGH TO TAKE IN REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SIGHT IN THE STERN CLIMBED TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFET IN HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEAD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET AN ASSORCER WETED WITH THE LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELLED AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WALL AND SAID WEEPING NO ARE YE PASSAGES THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARBLEIST MATTER DENOUNCING THAT WHO SIR COME TIED THOU SHALL SURELY DIE WITH THAT HEIGHT OF A ESCAPE FOR THAT IN THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIMB OF THE KING WHEREIN IS APULKA OF THY LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BIRTHBY PACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NOR MORE MONSTROUS

7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OUR MISCONCEPTION AS THE BROTHER BALLS GUILT

7105-2330-0002 VICTORY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AN INTENTIONY BLOWN UP THE OUTERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXINUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN EQUITAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE AN ASSISTANCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ANY IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SPITE OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF GLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 I HAD LONG BARDEN ON THE EVE OF A VIOL ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTEING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITH HELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE SOCIETY IN THE CROWDED CART AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND TO TAKE MACHINES IN WHITE HALL AND DONING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES

7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEON COATS HAD TURNED BETTER THAN EVER MISSUS BEATER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITH IMMEASURABLE DISTANCE

7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY HAD GASPED WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RESTENING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMAL PROPER AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARQUEBALD RACE STROKE AND THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISSER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND SYLVIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS CITY OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD NOT ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FOR TASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEM LIE HID TILL MORNING THAN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP LOSS ABOUT'S CREW ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SO
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTLE PIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY

7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS AND THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEEK IDIOT FUR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THAT HAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS

7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHY RACE STROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF

7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMOKERS DARED NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BOWERS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND GRAHAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MERCHANTMEN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 GRAHAM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE

7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GREAT AND EAGER SELLING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO A SHEATH

7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SIGNING PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DAY OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED FORCE NO MORE TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS A DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISON BILL SHE WENT TO WAVERLY WHERE SHE WAS HANDY CONTINUALLY
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT WASHINGTON WEEKLY

7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPHERD RED MARKERS AND BUDPENTS WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUAN TRAIL
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAY WAS A COMPANY BY BLOOD'S HEAD JUDGMENT PLAYING THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
7975-280076-0003 THE WAR WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION

7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GLISTEN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MENACOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 CAPTAIN MERDOC
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LONG FORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONE WALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DEROLEXON FAILURES HAD TO BE THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EATED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE STAYED FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOP KEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MERDOC WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT NEXT WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERY ONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT

8131-117016-0019 NOBODY HAD TRIED TO GET AND TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOR BALL GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF HEIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNIP CLUB IN HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 CORNON'S EYES POPPED AT THAT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR CUPS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE CUPS STARTED OFF

8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SICK AS GORDANS FELT
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0035 COLONEL THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDER TOOK HIS NOD IS EVIDENT ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TUFTS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS A RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH
8131-117016-0039 MARKOCK SAT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD

8131-117016-0047 MURDER BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES SLOWLY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAIN WILL BE RE ELECTED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTION
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU ARE FIRSTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP IN THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH A DIRE PREDICTION OF SECURITY AND WHAT THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FAIRER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST A MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE IS HE IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HAVE HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS OF THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE

8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS HERE
8131-117016-0060 THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE HAD SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS RE ELECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE FOSTER BULBS OF THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXEMPORIZED PRECING TESTS
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANY HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HALY SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARS SPEAKER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUN SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE

8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS SEVERALS HALFS TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I WILL TELL HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VERTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEAS OUGHT TO HAVE NO FORCE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMON AS THEY CONSENTED TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTEIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTMORUS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH CERTAIN INDUSTRY IS THE MOST LATENT AND THE LEAST EXCUSEABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED UP THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY DOWN THE CRIME TO BE CAPRAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NO WOMAN TO LOSE HIS HIT
8188-274364-0004 WITH A CHOKEEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WOULD HAVE FOUND AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME FOR MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR UNDISTRUCTION AWAKE THEIR SLEEPING LINES BY RETLING A COMPANY OF OLD RICKLES WHICH IT LAND FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WAR FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HAVE IT THESE GENTLEMEN OF THE BALL SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE CORN WEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET AND A FAVOUR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE COLONEL
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NO TROUBLED TO LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONG THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG THEY FOLDING UPON THIS PAPER OF NIGHTS DEEMED THE METAL OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PEN WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I ENTER TAKE A FEATS OF FOOL IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE FICTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM OWN RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DEATH WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER CHAUVELIN IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RANO LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0007 AND WHAT IT DID LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HARALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 DO YOU SON WAS A SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY
8280-266249-0010 SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THE PROBABLY COMPARATIVE THAT HE ARE AWAY TOBACCO AS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THAT IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S ALIKE
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACTED TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF THE DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCED NAUSIE AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKEERS USED A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUNDER TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKEERS AND CHEERERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE FRENCH POLLY TECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS A USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EX EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICED THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEBTS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKEERS AND CHEERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITH AN CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ASSETS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST FIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HANDSOME RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YOU ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GOD'S
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCYS OF GOD THAT YOU PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REGARD A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DAILY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LOWBORN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE THIN THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROMLY FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT BY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HOW
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORSE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY'RE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NO SIR HE IS NOT HERE
8280-266249-0033 AS THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TOO

8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL FLUGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME GO YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS

8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LITTLE BURN AND MISTER DAILY EACH OUT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT UP THE YOUNG MAN WORDS INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 THEY KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LOWER WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN A STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STATES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEN EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH GUESTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROUND STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS TO THE FORCE A NATURAL LAUGH

8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT AT THE DAILIES WHERE VERY STRAIGHTENED CIRCUMSTANCES

8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
